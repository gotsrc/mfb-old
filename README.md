# Welcome to Money for Blood.

Money for Blood (MFB) is a text turn & time based Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game
which you play in your browser. 

Set in the era of Al Capone and the New York Mafia's / Mobs then updated to a more 
modern feel. Create your own Mob, Commit various crimes - self or organised via the mob,
build weapons, ammunition, accept a contract and take down the user list in a fight to 
become a literal mob god.

Currently looking for developers to help with this project, must be proficient in PHP,
know how to use the CodeIgniter Framework, and also have a firm understanding of HTML5, CSS3 (SASS Preferred).

This game has been in the works for a very long time, and it is only now that there is enough time to actually
get this game working. Our old code base is still very much in tact and that is what you see here.
